## The Project

### For this project we designed and developed a fully responsive website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the Greensock library to create an engaging user experience with animations and captivating visuals. We created a one-page website with seven sections including a custom-made image gallery for the merchandising section made with JavaScript.

### Moreover, for this project we designed and produced an informational video using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe After Effects.
